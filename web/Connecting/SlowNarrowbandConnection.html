<P>You may be able to improve your dial-up connection speed by trying one or more of the suggestions below.  
You can return to these tips at any time by choosing <EM>Help</EM> from the Sign-in page and choosing <EM>Improving slow dial-up connections</EM>.</P>
<P>Select <EM><SCRIPT>if (FromConnectionHistory || FromHelp) {document.write("Done")} else {document.write("Continue")};</SCRIPT></EM> 
when you have finished reviewing these tips.</P>
<DIV class=title>Check your phone line and equipment</DIV>
<DIV class=description>Listen for static or noise on the phone line.  Try the following and see if the static is eliminated:
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Make sure your phone cable is snapped securely into the back of the unit and the wall jack.
<LI>If you use a phone splitter, remove it and plug your <SCRIPT>document.write(ProductShortName)</SCRIPT> directly into the phone wall jack.
<LI>Disconnect your answering machine, second phone, or other devices that share the phone line.
<LI>Try replacing your phone cord.
</UL>
After doing each step, listen for static.  If the above tips do not help and you still hear static on the line, 
contact your phone company and have them perform a <I>frequency sweep and general line test</I>.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class=title>Check your connection speed</DIV>
<DIV class=description>
With Connection History, you can look at your recent connection rates and then try to improve your connection speed.
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>From the Sign-in page, press the <EM>Favs</EM> key on your keyboard.  The System Info page appears.
<LI>Choose <EM>Connection History</EM>. You’ll see a list that shows what happened when your player dialed 
<SCRIPT>document.write(ServiceShortName)</SCRIPT>; the date 
and time you connected (or attempted to connect), the “Rate” (connection speed), and the access number that was dialed.
<LI>For even more information (such as errors that occurred), choose the blue code number to the left of a Connection History 
listing to view error messages and additional troubleshooting steps.
</UL>
<P>If your connection rates are consistently lower than average, you should choose more access numbers, as described below.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class=title>Choose the best access numbers</DIV>
<DIV class=description>
<P>In most cases, you'll get the fastest connection speed if you choose all the local numbers on 
the Access Numbers page.</P>
<P><EM>Note</EM>: Keep in mind that 
some access numbers might result in long-distance charges on your phone bill, even if the number is in your area code. 
Check with your phone company to make sure the numbers you’ve chosen are local calls.</P>
<P>If there are no additional numbers to choose from, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and choose 
<EM>Get more access numbers</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>Tip:</EM> In general, the access numbers at the top of the list will provide the 
fastest connection rate.</P>
<P>To select access numbers:
<UL>
<LI>Choose <EM>Settings</EM> from the Sign-in page.
<LI>Choose <EM>Choose connection settings</EM>.
<LI>Choose <EM>MSN TV access numbers</EM>, then choose <EM>Continue</EM>, The Access Numbers page appears.
</UL>
</P>
<P>The Access Numbers page gives you a few ways to try and improve your connection rate:
<UL>
<LI>If your Connection History shows that a particular number is connecting at a slow “Rate,” you can deselect that number 
(remove the checkmark) on this page.
<LI>To increase your chances of a faster connection rate, you can select additional local numbers from the list.
<LI>Choose <EM>Connect</EM>.
</UL>
</P>
<P>To determine whether these tips improved your 
connection speed, you can check your recent connection rates in Connection History (the most recent connections are 
at the top of the list.)</P>
<P>If the tips did not improve your connection speed, contact your phone company and have them perform a 
<I>frequency sweep and general line test</I>.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV class=title>Other suggestions</DIV>
<DIV class=description>
<P>If you try these tips and still experience slow connection rates, you might want to consider using a broadband
connection (DSL or cable modem), which will provide enhanced <SCRIPT>document.write(ServiceShortName)</SCRIPT> 
service.  Check with your phone company or
cable provider to see if they offer broadband services.</P>
<P><EM>Note</EM>:  Your phone company or cable provider 
will bill you for broadband equipment and services.  You will need to pay these fees in addition to your 
<SCRIPT>document.write(ServiceShortName)</SCRIPT> subscription.
