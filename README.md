# msn-tv2-v5.6.7021

Contents of the `web` and `SYS` CompressFS partitions from version 5.6.7021.0 of the MSN TV 2 firmware, extracted using [UTVImage](https://archive.org/details/compressfs-tools).

`web` contains the HTML pages, scripts, and assets used by the MSN TV 2 OS for the user interface and panels. `SYS` contains DLLs for drivers and other components of the MSN TV 2 (Word/PDF reader, etc.)

Some files (namely images) from the `web` partition have been removed due to them being corrupted when using the current tool available (UTVImage) to extract the partitions. A list of the removed files is in MISSING_FILES.md.
